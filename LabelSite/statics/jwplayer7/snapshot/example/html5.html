<p>
This demonstrates manually capturing a video frame to a jpeg image and saving to a backend service.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Capture of video frame from any http or rtmp streaming source with StreamVideoSampleAccess enabled.</li>
    <li>Support for Adobe HTTP Streaming is now possible due to some security sandbox workarounds.</li>
    <li>Capture support for Flash Vimeo based streams is possible although Youtube and Dailymotion have restrictive policies so will not work.</li>
    <li>Jpeg and PNG encoding on the fly with a quality setting for jpeg encoding.</li>
    <li>Javascript api service to automate the capture.</li>
    <li>Returning base64 encoded image to preview in html via the Javascript api.</li>
    <li>Example backend included to demonstrate saving the image sent.</li>
    <li>Csrf token security support.</li>
    <li>Local client download support. </li>
    <li>Resize scaling feature for larger videos.</li>
    <li>Thumbnail creation support.</li>
	<li>Support for Stage Video enabled streaming with some work arounds for Safari and Firefox.</li>
    <li>Support HLS and Adobe HTTP Streaming streaming with some work arounds for security sandbox constraints.</li>
    <li>Support for Flash HLS Streaming with the use of a built in playback feature to work around Flash sandbox security contraints and JWPlayer api design flaws which prevents the ability to access it's stream and video for switching out of stage video etc.
    This requires reloading the stream and seeking to the current time before capture therefore a tiny delay beforehand. For live streams the seeking may not be frame accurate due to the work around requirements but a tiny backwards cache is enabled to allow for it. With multi bitrate streams the largest bitrate manifest will be used for capture.</li>
    <li>Support for RTMP, HLS and HDS live streaming capture.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Html5 Features</h2>

<ul>
        <li>Capture of video frame from any http streaming source that is supported in the browser with <a href="http://enable-cors.org/">Cross Origin Resource Sharing  enabled</a> and a browser that supports the canvas element, a fallback for IE is supplied.</li>
        <li>Jpeg and PNG encoding on the fly with a quality setting for jpeg encoding.</li>
        <li>Javascript api service to automate the capture.</li>
        <li>Returning the canvas to display in a preview window.</li>
        <li>Example backend included to demonstrate saving the image sent.</li>
        <li>Csrf token security support.</li>
        <li>Includes a Notification plugin to display user feedback. </li>
        <li>Now works with Cloudfront video. Cloudfront now supports the OPTIONS request method which is sent via the browser to validate the cross origin request. see <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html">http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html</a>.</li>
        <li>Cors support for browsers lacking crossOrigin video tag specs like Safari and IE using a proxy solution.</li>
        <li>Local downloads support for Chrome and Firefox. Safari lacks special file download features and therefore requires to be opened in a new tab. </li>
        <li>Support and tested in Chrome,Firefox,Safari, IE 11 for now. (Safari and IE11 both need the CORS proxy). Possibly support for IE9-IE10 with canvas and blob support fallbacks included.</li>
		<li>Supports capturing HLS in Html5 in Safari when the CORS proxy is enabled.</li>
		<li>Local client download support with some work arounds for Safari due to some standards issues. </li>
		<li>Resize scaling feature for larger videos.</li>
        <li>Thumbnail creation support.</li>
        <li>Works with HLS streams in Safari.</li>
</ul>




<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li>RTMP streams require the StreamVideoSampleAccess or VideoSampleAccess enabled to be able to capture the video data in Wowza and Flash Media Server. See
    <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flashmediaserver/3.0/docs/help.html?content=08_xmlref_168.html">http://livedocs.adobe.com/flashmediaserver/3.0/docs/help.html?content=08_xmlref_168.html</a> and
    <a href="http://www.wowza.com/resources/WowzaMediaServer_ConfigurationReference.pdf">http://www.wowza.com/resources/WowzaMediaServer_ConfigurationReference.pdf</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Both HDDN and Cloudfront RTMP do not have these video sample data access settings enabled unfortunately so only Http progressive download will work with these CDN's.</li>
    <li>Hddn's Flash crossdomain master policy file is empty therefore data access to the http streams are not possible for now due to Flash crossdomain sandbox issues and the requirement of a root policy file.</li>
    <li>As above requires a crossdomain.xml policy file configured on the server for http based streams for this feature to work correctly.</li>
    <li>CDN's such as S3 which implement 302 redirection cause issues with the stream obtaining the crossdomain policy file in the background a fallback system is in place
    to obtain the policy file from the domain of the requested video instead.</li>
    <li>There is limitations with the JW Player provider api making the plugin unavailable to obtain the netstream and the raw video display. This is required when stage video is enabled and the need to switch the stream back to a normal video display for rendering the frame.
    Customised HTTP and RTMP provider plugins are provided to work with the plugin when required.</li>
    <li>For local client download support any files from Cloudfront which has redirections which requires reloading of security policies, user interaction is required to initiate the download after capture. A notification is provided to notify this. Due to flaws with the JWPlayer API a delay is required when capturing stage video content which is enabled by default. User interaction therefore is also required. </li>
	<li>Due to flaws with the Jwplayer API and the requirement for custom providers to obtain the video, stage video and netstreams.</li>
	<li>In Stage Video streaming mode the stream requires to switch to normal video display for capture. Workarounds are required for bugs in Safari and Firefox on OSX when switching back after capture.</li>
    <li>For RTMP live streaming and Stage Video mode which is enabled in JWPlayer by default, the stream requires to restart after capture to workaround a Firefox and Safari bug.</li>
    <li>A work around is required for HLS and HDS streaming due to Flash security sandbox contrains and the type of streaming does not rely on cross domain policies. This prevents capture therefore modifications have been made to the plugins to accomodate this feature.</li>
	<li>The JWPlayer HLS Edition feature is closed sourced and the player Flash Api is severely limited and flawed so the plugin is unable to obtain it's stream for providing the sandbox security work around and switching out of stage video. An alternative work around for capturing is required. This requires reloading the stream and seeking to the current position before capture and incurs a delay. The seeking to bring up the required position may not be frame accurate for live streams. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Html5 Known Issues</h2>
    <ul>
         <li>Only works for now in Chrome and Firefox browsers. Safari / Webkit / IE 11 will work with same origin videos, it does not have support for cross origin with the video tag therefore the canvas cannot obtain the image. A proxy work around is required to make it function.  see
        <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-video-element.html#attr-media-crossorigin">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-video-element.html#attr-media-crossorigin</a>.</li>
        <li>The video server backend requires to have Cors support enabled with the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header.</li>
        <li>Does not work with Cloudfront video yet as Cloudfront does not support the OPTIONS request method which is sent via the browser to validate the cross origin request therefore returns errors and the video does not load. S3 has support for Cors rules see <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html">http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html</a>.</li>
        <li>Considered a very experimental feature until Cors / Canvas / Html5 video is standardised.</li>
        <li>Local file downloads support is considered experimental until all browsers support file download attributes.</li>
        <li>Safari has problems with local save api's and will attempt to launch a new tab to be manually saved via command-s, it also can not handle mimetypes delivered to it, this is due to standards issues with the html5 api functions. Firefox,IE 11 all bring up file dialogs and Chrome will download automatically with no file dialog being able to be forced. File saving in html5 is considered experimental due to all these inconsistencies.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Note:</h2>
<p>Due to the requirement of including a completely seperate HLS streaming solution for HLS capture the plugin is broken up into 3 different versions. The default includes both functionality for Http,RTMP and HLS streaming and two seperate plugins are for HLS or HTTP/RTMP only.</p>



<h3>(Current Version 3.0)</h3>

        <td class="description">
            The snapshot preview display style.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>


<h3>Filename Configuration</h3>
<p>To test a custom filename for the capture image configure this on the clip or playlist config using the `snapshot.name` property: </p>

<div class="box code">
<pre><code class="javascript">
 ...
 {
    ...
    "snapshot.name" : "test",
    ...
 }
 ...
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Dimension Configuration For Single Bitrate HLS</h3>
<p>For single bitrate HLS streams which does not provide dimensions the following properties can be set to provide these for capture: </p>

<div class="box code">
<pre><code class="javascript">
 ...
 {
    clipWidth: 960,
    clipHeight: 540
 }
 ...
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Token Server</h3>

<p>The configured token server must return a csrf hash in a json object string like so: </p>

<div class="box code">
<pre><code class="javascript">
 {"token":"f38c9bd8483916513f057a6ea71a6d24"}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Backend Server</h3>

<p>Included is a backend server which demonstrates handling the post data and the image sent as a base64 encoded string, the server should provide the parameter and token
hash security and base64 decode the image as a string and store on the server. The following properties are required or optional: </p>

<table class="listing">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th nowrap>property / datatype</th>
			<th>required</th>
			<th>description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>

    <tr>
        <td class="code">image <div class="type">string</div></td>
        <td class="code default">true</td>
        <td class="description">
            The image stored as a base64 encoded string.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="code">type <div class="type">string</div></td>
        <td class="code default">true</td>
        <td class="description">
            The image type chosen either jpg or png.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
            <td class="code">token <div class="type">string</div></td>
            <td class="code default">false</td>
            <td class="description">
                The csrf token to use with the save request, if a token is configured this can be used to check the request.
            </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="code">name <div class="type">string</div></td>
        <td class="code default">false</td>
        <td class="description">
			The name of the image to use when saving.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>


<h3>Cross Domain Policy</h3>

<p>To gain access to the video sample data for http based streams and for the backend service both require a cross domain policy file named `crossdomain.xml`
and placed into the top level location of that domain or configured with the `policyURL` config.</p>

<div class="box code">
<pre><code class="xml">
&lt;cross-domain-policy xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=&quot;http://www.adobe.com/xml/schemas/PolicyFile.xsd&quot;&gt;
&lt;allow-access-from domain=&quot;*.electroteque.org&quot;/&gt;
&lt;allow-access-from domain=&quot;localhost&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/cross-domain-policy&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Rtmp Server Access</h3>

<p>Rtmp servers like FMS, Wowza and Red5 require config changes to enable access to video sample data. </p>

<h4>Flash Media Server</h4>

<p>Locate the `Application.xml` file within the configuration directory and edit the xml config `VideoSampleAccess` to locations of paths in the content directory like so: </p>

<div class="box code">
<pre><code class="xml">
&lt;VideoSampleAccess enabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt;low_quality;high_quality&lt;/VideoSampleAccess&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<h4>Wowza</h4>

<p>Locate the `Application.xml` file within the application configuration directory and edit the xml config `StreamVideoSampleAccess` with an asterix `*` to enable access to all files. </p>

<div class="box code">
<pre><code class="html">
&lt;Client&gt;
			&lt;IdleFrequency&gt;-1&lt;/IdleFrequency&gt;
			&lt;Access&gt;
				&lt;StreamReadAccess&gt;*&lt;/StreamReadAccess&gt;
				&lt;StreamWriteAccess&gt;*&lt;/StreamWriteAccess&gt;
				&lt;StreamAudioSampleAccess&gt;*&lt;/StreamAudioSampleAccess&gt;
				&lt;StreamVideoSampleAccess&gt;*&lt;/StreamVideoSampleAccess&gt;
				&lt;SharedObjectReadAccess&gt;*&lt;/SharedObjectReadAccess&gt;
				&lt;SharedObjectWriteAccess&gt;*&lt;/SharedObjectWriteAccess&gt;
			&lt;/Access&gt;
&lt;/Client&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<h4>Red5</h4>

<p>In the application WEB-INF path locate the file `red5-web.xml` and add bean properties like so : </p>

<div class="box code">
<pre><code class="xml">
&lt;bean id=&quot;rtmpSampleAccess&quot; class=&quot;org.red5.server.stream.RtmpSampleAccess&quot;&gt;
&lt;property name=&quot;audioAllowed&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
&lt;property name=&quot;videoAllowed&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>



<h3>CORS Requirements For Cloudfront</h3>

<p>Cloudfront now supports CORS and delivers OPTIONS requests. </p>
<p>To enable OPTIONS support in Cloudfront goto the "Edit Behaviour" section of the Cloudfront distribution, check "OPTIONS" in the "Cached HTTP Methods" section and add all the suggested Whitelist Headers selection.</p>
<p>This information may change but this should make it function correctly. The OPTIONS request for CORS is sent before the actual request as is required to make capture possible.</p>



<h3>CORS Proxy</h3>

<p>A CORS proxy is required to work around limitations with cross origin support on the video tag like with IE and Safari.</p>
<p>Using either Apache or Nginx server configs assuming the proxy module is enabled can be achieved like so:</p>


<p>Apache:</p>
<div class="box code">
<pre><code class="javascript">
    ProxyPass /video/ http://videos.electroteque.org/
    ProxyPassReverse /video/ http://videos.electroteque.org/
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Nginx:</p>
<div class="box code">
<pre><code class="javascript">
    location /video/ {
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;
        proxy_pass http://videos.electroteque.org/;
        proxy_redirect off;
    }
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Which translates to:</p>

<div class="box code">
<pre><code class="javascript">
    http://origin.electroteque.org/video/big_buck_bunny_480p_h264.mp4
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2>CORS Rules Requirements</h2>

<p>For this feature to work successfully both the backend server and the video hosting server require <a href="http://enable-cors.org/">Cross Origin Resource Sharing</a> rules to be enabled in the headers of the request.<br>
   This is required to enable cross origin Ajax requests when posting the captured image data and to be able to gain access to the video data within a Html5 video tag.
</p>

<p>
   The header of the cors request must expose a `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header with either a multiple list of domains including ports if using ports or an asterix wildcard to allow all domains. <br>
    A `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` can be exposed to control what request methods are allowed. For authenticated logins with cookies the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header must be enabled
    and the feature will pass cookie sessions and other cookies along with the request.
</p>

<p>
    An example request header can look like the following:
</p>

<div class="box code">
<pre><code class="javascript">
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:8000
    Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET
    Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Accept
    Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
    Content-Type: application/json
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Testing CORS Server Requests</h3>

<p>
    CORS server requests can be initiated with the following curl command:
</p>

<div class="box code">
<pre><code class="javascript">
    curl -I -H "Origin: http://localhost:8000" http://path/to/server
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Enabling CORS on S3</h3>

<p>
    Follow the guide <a hef="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html">here</a> to enable CORS rules on the bucket. Cloudfront does not function just yet because Chrome will send an OPTIONS request method which it does not allow. <br><br>

    The CORS header should look like the following:
</p>

<div class="box code">
<pre><code class="javascript">
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:8000
    Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, HEAD
    Access-Control-Max-Age: 3000
    Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
    Vary: Origin, Access-Control-Request-Headers, Access-Control-Request-Method
</code></pre>
